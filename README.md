# Modest Movie Metadata

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A very simple tool to generate Jellyfin folder names using data from IMDb 
and (hopefully coming soon) TMDB. 

Designed for almost hands-free use:

1. Monitors the clipboard for IMDb IDs. 
2. Automatically writes generated folder names to the clipboard.

Developed with Python 3.12 and PySide 6.6. Tested under Windows 10 and 11.
